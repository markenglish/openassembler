OpenAssembler have a console mode this is the most basic interface for oas.
I suggest to start with this one, and than later you can open up everything else.

You can start the oas console like this:
{{{
OpenAssembler -m console
}}}
or
{{{
python OpenAssembler.py -m console
}}}


then you will get this prompt:
{{{
OpenAssembler--->
}}}

After some time (quite soon) you will get a message from the server, like this one:
{{{
OpenAssembler Server started at 172.18.58.83:23345 !
}}}

It is because the server is automatically started with the console, and it was indicateing that messages are accepted over the remote console.
