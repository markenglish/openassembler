OpenAssembler have a console mode this is the most basic interface for oas.
I suggest to start with this one, and than later you can open up everything else.

You can start the oas console like this:
{{{
OpenAssembler -m console
}}}
or
{{{
python OpenAssembler.py -m console
}}}


then you will get this prompt:
{{{
OpenAssembler--->
}}}

After some time (quite soon) you will get a message from the server, like this one:
{{{
OpenAssembler Server started at 192.168.0.1:23345 !
}}}

It is because the server is automatically started with the console, and it was indicateing that messages are accepted over the remote console.


==Console commands==

Console is a very important tool for OpenAssembler! You can reach every tool and command with simply typing the proper command after the prompt. You can open, save, create nodes, run them open, a gui element... everything you want and you ever need.
