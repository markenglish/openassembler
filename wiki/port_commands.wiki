The port module is cooperating with the console module, so we can accept all the comamnds with the same way as it was in the commansline interface. 

Plusz a few more:

  * current_file, which will answer the current opened scene if there are any.
  * variabletypes, will answer all the veriabletypes and variablecategoryes
  * check, you can use it like: check 23346 will check you the port 23346
  * refresh, this will send a refresh request for the gui, it is important to keep in sync
  * positions, you can use like: positions <node> 20 40, this will set node to x=20 y=40
