==Basic OpenAssembler v2 tutorial==

I hope the install vas sucesfull, you downloaded the files extract them, edited and copied the ini file to the ~/.OpenAssembler folder. If so, and you have all the requirements than you can run oas.

So,

Lets start oas with the following command (I guess you are in the oas folder)

{{{
python OpenAssembler.py -m console
}}}

Fingers crossed XXXX and..

You have to see something similar:
{{{
OpenAssembler--->
OpenAssembler Server started at 192.168.0.1:23345 !

}}}

If you see the same, well this is something like positive start.

Press a few enter, to get a clean prompt, like this:
{{{
OpenAssembler--->
}}}

Well, first of all, we need to know what type of nodes you have.

For the complete command reference, check the console page.

So,

{{{
ln
}}}

You will see something liek this.
