#summary Wiki for OpenAssembler.

= Introduction =

OpenAssembler is collection of python tools. Ensure more visual controll and representation for the user over the vfx pipeline.

Goals: Create a node-based open environment which is easily extendable and customizable.

==== Structure and status: ====

 NodeSliderBar(99%): Where your initial nodes take places, you can slide the nodes to extend the staks.
  Initial tests, idea: Done
  Codeing, tests: Done
  Xml based: Done
  '''Resizeable: Not started''' (takes 10 minutes when everything else is ready)

 NodeEditorCanvas(85%): Where you can work with the nodes...
  Initial tests, idea: Done
  Node generation: Done
  Node positions write back to runtimeXML: Not started (takes 1 hour when the save-specific-attribute-backtoXML process is ready)
  Accessing node funtionality (on-node buttons...): WIP
   Kill button: working
   Preferences button: working
   '''Note button: not working''' (takes 3-5 hours to find out and code)
   '''Run/Examine button: not working''' (takes 10 minutes when the luncher process is ready)
  Connection line mechanism and generation: Done
  '''Connection poit attributes write back to runtimeXML: Not started''' (takes 1 hour when the save-specific-attribute-backtoXML process is ready)
  Deleting nodes: Done
  Zoom, Move, Reset view, Snap to center: Done (maybe some adjustment needed after the resizing...)
  Rename nodes: Done (maybe more option will come for renaming nodes...)
  '''Miniature view for the complete scene: Not started''' (takes 1 day but not se important so I will do it when everything else is working)
  '''Resizeable: Not started''' (takes 10 minutes when everything else is ready)

 PreferencePlane(40%): Where you can set the preferences and settings for nodes and for the main scene preferences too...
  Initial tests: Done
  Load from xml: Done
  Build up the controllers: Done
  Current controller list: WIP
   Path: Done
   Boolean: Done
   '''Number: Not started''' (takes 1 hour)
   '''Number with slider: Not Started''' (takes 1 hour)
   '''Color: Not started''' (takes 2 days)
   .
   .
   .
  '''Settings saved back to xml: Not started''' (takes 1 day, this is top important now!!!)
  '''Resizeable: Not started''' (takes 10 minutes when everything else is ready)

 TimeLine(timeline: 99% other buttons on this shelf: 20%): Where you can set the time-range and the curent frame, and there are other important buttons on this shelf
  Initial test: Done
  Time-range and current frame: Done
  Delete node button: Done
  '''Run this node (Entry and button): Not started''' (takes 3 hours when the run function is working)
  Any other function button can be here...
   .
   .
   .
  '''Resizeable: Not started''' (takes 10 minutes when everything else is ready)

 MenuLine(0%): Where you can access the basic features New/Save/Load and maybe shot-based path setter...
  Init: Done
  '''New/Save/Load buttons: Not yet started''' (takes 1 day the save button when the xml handler tool is finsihed, 2-3 days the load button and 5 hour the new scene button.)
  Any other function button can be here...
   .
   .
   .
  '''Resizeable: Not started''' (takes 10 minutes when everything else is ready)

 DBaseManagement: Where we have all our functions to manage xml databases
  ''(Maybe later I have to rewrite it from scratch and keep all datas in memory and write them out with the save function
   and maybe I have to construct a more logic and structured code, but it is working now, so no problem at all)''
  Initial tests, idea: Done (maybe re-written once)
  XML base handlers: Done
  Init runtimeXML: Done
  Register runtime nodes: Done
  Generate unique node IDs: Done
  Register line: Done
  Delete items: Done
  Change node name: Done
  Get slider bar node list: Done
  Setup node basic variables: Done
  Load preferences from xml to preference plane: Done
  '''Write back specific data attribute and value to xml: Not started''' (takes about a day or a littlebit more... this is the most important)
  '''Generate scene specific settings and link it to the runtimeXML: Not started'''
  '''Save connection parameters to xml: Not started'''
  '''Save node positions: Not started'''
  '''Save scene: Not started'''
  '''Load scene: Not started'''

 Running mechanism(0%): Processes and functions to run your node network
  '''Idea: The idea is thet every node contains several python functions which will be organized and executed like a python script... this was never tested but I am almost 100% sure it will work.
  This will take a few week to complete... and it is posseable that it will require to rewrite something or re-think something in the existing code. Fingers crossed...'''
