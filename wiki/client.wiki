The client mode is very similar to the console mode but you can access any OpenAssembler server on any machine

You can start the oas client like this:
{{{
OpenAssembler -m client
}}}
or
{{{
python OpenAssembler.py -m client
}}}

This will connect you to the localmachine's default port-oas-server.

then you will get this prompt (this is different a littlebit from the simple console prompt):
{{{
OpenAssembler:
}}}

==Client commands==

You cna use the same commands as for the console. The only difference is that your *answers will be a littlebit different*. This is with the reason to able to parse the ansers simply.

For the commands, please check the [console] wiki.
