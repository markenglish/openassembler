=Create a node=

It is very easy to create a node for OpenAssembler.

All you need to do is to follow a few rule for the script layout.

Well lets start an example:

You want to create a node to handle all the math functions.

You need to start with an identifier line:
{{{
###OpenAssembler Node python file###
}}}

Then you need to tell to the interface about your nodes, your inputs your outputs, and some other stuffs.

You need to indicate the name of the node like this:
{{{
    name multiMath
}}}
then you need to tag it:
{{{
   tags anything:something:more
}}}
and after you need to specify the connection points: first the side: input/output and the variabletype int/float/string/... and then the name like A.. than the default value and at last any option if you want
If you have any space in your value or in your option, you have tu use ""
So here is an example line:
{{{
   input int A 1 "min=0 max=100"
}}}
