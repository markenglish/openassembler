You can istall OpenAssembler several way:

  # You download the executeable-package from this site
  # You download the python scripts from this site, and you running them
  # svn checkout http://openassembler.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ openassembler-read-only


After you get it, you can copy it somewhere, and it is ready to use.

It is worth to include its path to the global environment.

Maybe you need to edit the setup file (was generated automaticaly on the first run)

The setup file is in your home directory under the folder: *.OpenAssembler*
