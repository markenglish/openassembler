With normal start you will have the normal console without the server. I recomend you the server version.

To start oas without the server: (to remember: gui will not work without the server)

{{{
python OpenAssembler.py
}}}

==Console commands==

Console is a very important tool for OpenAssembler! You can reach every tool and command with simply typing the proper command after the prompt. You can open, save, create nodes, run them open, a gui element... everything you want and you ever need.

Here are the list of the commands:

  # [exit]
  # [list]
  # [count]
  # [create]
  # [delete]
  # [rename]
  # [show]
  # [connect]
  # [end]
  # [set]
  # [frame]
  # [framerange]
  # [run_console run]
  # [new]
  # [open]
  # [save]
